      <h1 id="externalities">Externalities</h1>
<p>Externalities are a concept in economics that refer to the impact that the actions of one person or group have on the well-being of others, without that impact being reflected in market prices. This guide will cover the basics of externalities, including different types of externalities and their effects, as well as some of the policy tools that can be used to address them.</p>
<h2 id="what-are-externalities">What are Externalities?</h2>
<p>Externalities occur when the actions of one person or group affect the welfare of others in a way that is not reflected in market prices. These effects can be positive (known as “<em>positive externalities</em>”) or negative (known as “<em>negative externalities</em>”).</p>
<p>For example, if a company creates a new park in a city, it may have a positive externality on nearby businesses by attracting more people to the area. On the other hand, if a factory emits pollution that harms the health of nearby residents, it may have a negative externality on those residents.</p>
<h2 id="types-of-externalities">Types of Externalities</h2>
<p>There are two main types of externalities: positive and negative.</p>
<h3 id="positive-externalities">Positive Externalities</h3>
<p>Positive externalities occur when an action taken by one person or group benefits others, without those others paying for or otherwise compensating for the benefit. Goods that exhibit a positive externality are called <strong>Merit Goods</strong>. Some examples of positive externalities include:</p>
<ul>
<li>Education: An individual who receives education can contribute to the economy and society as a whole, which benefits others.</li>
<li>Vaccinations: When individuals receive vaccinations, they help to prevent the spread of diseases to others who may not have been vaccinated.</li>
<li>Research and development: Advances in science and technology can benefit society as a whole.</li>
</ul>
<h3 id="negative-externalities">Negative Externalities</h3>
<p>Negative externalities occur when an action taken by one person or group harms others, without those others being compensated for the harm. Goods that exhibit a negative externality are called <strong>Demerit Goods</strong>.Some examples of negative externalities include:</p>
<ul>
<li>Pollution: When a factory emits pollutants into the air or water, nearby residents may suffer health effects.</li>
<li>Traffic congestion: When too many cars are on the road, it can create delays for other drivers and increase air pollution.</li>
<li>Noise pollution: Loud noises from a construction site or loud music from a neighboring apartment can disturb the peace of nearby residents.</li>
</ul>
<h2 id="effects-of-externalities">Effects of Externalities</h2>
<p>Externalities can have a variety of effects on different groups of people. Some of the effects include:</p>
<ul>
<li>Distorted market prices: When the cost of a good or service does not reflect its true social cost, it can lead to overproduction or overconsumption of that good or service.</li>
<li>Inefficient resource allocation: Externalities can cause resources to be used in ways that are not efficient, such as when a company pollutes instead of investing in cleaner technologies.</li>
<li>Market failure: The inefficient resource allocation is a market failure as it doesn’t maximise the total social welfare. This is when the the free market doesn’t produce the best outcome for society as a whole.</li>
<li>Unequal distribution of benefits and costs: Externalities can lead to some groups of people benefiting at the expense of others, such as when a company pollutes and nearby residents suffer the health effects.</li>
</ul>
<h2 id="policy-tools-for-addressing-externalities">Policy Tools for Addressing Externalities</h2>
<p>There are several policy tools that can be used to address externalities:</p>
<h3 id="taxes-and-subsidies-this-is-the-most-important-one">Taxes and Subsidies <em>This is the most important one</em></h3>
<p>Taxes and subsidies can be used to internalize externalities. A tax can be imposed on activities that create negative externalities, such as pollution, to make the cost of those activities more accurately reflect their social cost. A subsidy can be given to activities that create positive externalities, such as education, to encourage more of those activities.</p>
<h3 id="regulation">Regulation</h3>
<p>Regulation can be used to require companies to take actions to reduce negative externalities. For example, regulations can require companies to install pollution control equipment or to use cleaner technologies.</p>
