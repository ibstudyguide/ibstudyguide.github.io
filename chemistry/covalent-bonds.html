<h2 id="covalent-electron-dots">Covalent Electron Dots</h2>
<p>Covalent molecules are formed when two or more atoms share electrons to form a stable compound. Covalent electron dots are used to represent the sharing of electrons between the atoms. In this notation, a dot represents an electron. Each atom can only share electrons that are in their outermost energy level, also known as the valence shell.Hereâ€™s a step-by-step guide on how to draw covalent electron dots:</p>
<ol>
<li>
<p>Determine the number of valence electrons: Find the number of valence electrons in each atom that will be involved in the covalent bond. This is usually the outermost shell of electrons.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Determine the bonding electrons: The bonding electrons are the electrons that are shared between the atoms. To determine the number of bonding electrons, add the number of valence electrons from each atom and divide by 2.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Draw the atoms and their valence electrons: Draw the atoms that are involved in the covalent bond and then place their valence electrons around them. Place the electrons in pairs around each atom. Make sure to only use the valence electrons.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Connect the atoms: Draw a line between the two atoms to represent the covalent bond that is being formed. Each line represents a pair of shared electrons.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Assign the remaining electrons: After drawing the covalent bond, assign any remaining electrons to the atoms. These are called non-bonding or lone pairs.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Check the octet rule (HL only): The octet rule states that atoms tend to gain, lose or share electrons in order to have a full outer shell of eight electrons. Make sure that each atom has an octet of electrons or as close to eight electrons as possible.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Add charges if necessary: If any atoms have gained or lost electrons in the process of forming a covalent bond, then charges will need to be added to the atoms to show this.</p>
</li>
</ol>
<h2 id="dative-bonds">Dative Bonds</h2>
<p>A dative bond, also known as a coordinate covalent bond, is a type of covalent bond in which one atom provides both of the electrons involved in the shared pair. In a regular covalent bond, each atom contributes one electron to form a shared pair. However, in a dative bond, one atom has a lone pair of electrons, and the other atom has an incomplete valence shell, meaning it requires additional electrons to achieve stability.</p>
<p>The atom with the lone pair donates both of its electrons to the other atom, which can then use them to form a covalent bond. The atom that donates the electrons is called the donor atom, and the atom that accepts the electrons is called the acceptor atom. The donor atom is often a negatively charged ion, while the acceptor atom is often a positively charged ion or a molecule with an incomplete valence shell.</p>
<p>One example of a dative bond is the bond between the boron atom and one of the fluorine atoms in the molecule BF3. In this molecule, the boron atom has an incomplete valence shell and can only form three covalent bonds with the three fluorine atoms. However, the fourth fluorine atom shares its lone pair of electrons with the boron atom to form a dative bond. The bond is represented by an arrow pointing from the donor atom to the acceptor atom, indicating the direction of the electron flow.</p>
<h2 id="covalent-networks">Covalent Networks</h2>
<p>Covalent networks are a group of compounds that are formed by covalent bonds between atoms. Unlike other types of compounds, covalent networks have high melting points, high boiling points, and are insoluble in water. They also have a high degree of hardness and are very stable. Covalent networks are formed by non-metals and have a unique crystal structure.</p>
<h3 id="graphite">Graphite</h3>
<p>Graphite is one of the most common covalent network compounds. It is composed of carbon atoms that are covalently bonded together in a hexagonal lattice structure. This lattice structure gives graphite its unique properties. Graphite is a good conductor of electricity due to the presence of delocalized electrons that move through the lattice structure. It is also a good lubricant due to the weak Van der Waals forces between the layers. Graphite has a high melting point and is very stable.</p>
<h3 id="diamond">Diamond</h3>
<p>Diamond is another common covalent network compound. It is composed of carbon atoms that are covalently bonded together in a tetrahedral lattice structure. This lattice structure gives diamond its unique properties. Diamond is one of the hardest substances known to man, and is used in cutting tools and jewelry. It is also a good conductor of heat due to the rigid lattice structure.</p>
<h3 id="silicon-dioxide">Silicon Dioxide</h3>
<p>Silicon dioxide is a covalent network compound that is composed of silicon and oxygen atoms that are covalently bonded together in a tetrahedral lattice structure. Silicon dioxide is one of the main components of sand and quartz. It has a high melting point and is very stable.</p>
<h2 id="buckminsterfullerenes">Buckminsterfullerenes</h2>
<p>Buckminsterfullerenes is composed of 60 carbon atoms that are covalently bonded together in a unique spherical shape. The structure resembles a soccer ball, with 12 pentagonal faces and 20 hexagonal faces. The carbon atoms are arranged in a way that creates a network of covalent bonds that gives the compound its stability.</p>
<p>Buckminsterfullerenes has a number of unique properties due to its structure. It is a good conductor of electricity due to the presence of delocalized electrons that move through the lattice structure. It also has a high melting point and is very stable. Buckminsterfullerene is insoluble in water, but can dissolve in certain organic solvents. It is also known for its ability to form complex structures and compounds with other molecules, making it useful in a variety of applications.</p>
