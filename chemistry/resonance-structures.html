<p>Resonance structures are different ways of drawing the same molecule, showing the distribution of electrons within a molecule. In this study guide, we will cover the key concepts related to resonance structures.</p>
<h2 id="what-is-a-resonance-structure">What is a Resonance Structure?</h2>
<p>A resonance structure is a hypothetical structure that shows the delocalization of electrons in a molecule. It is used to explain the stability and reactivity of molecules that cannot be represented by a single Lewis structure. Resonance structures are not actual forms of the molecule, but rather different ways of depicting the distribution of electrons in a molecule.</p>
<h2 id="how-to-draw-resonance-structures">How to Draw Resonance Structures</h2>
<p>There are several steps to follow when drawing resonance structures:</p>
<ol>
<li>Draw the Lewis structure for the molecule.</li>
<li>Identify atoms that can change their formal charges by moving electrons.</li>
<li>Determine which atoms should donate or accept electrons to minimize formal charges.</li>
<li>Draw different resonance structures by moving electrons and keeping the overall charge and number of electrons constant.</li>
<li>Finally you can draw the resonance hybrid with dotted lines where the bonds would be, or a circle in the case of benzene.<br>
