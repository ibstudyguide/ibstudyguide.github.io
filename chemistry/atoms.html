      <h1 id="atoms">Atoms</h1>
<p>Atoms are the building blocks of matter. They are made up of protons, neutrons, and electrons.</p>
<h2 id="proton">Proton</h2>
<p>A proton is a subatomic particle with a positive charge. It is found in the nucleus of an atom. The number of protons in an atom determines what element it is.</p>
<h2 id="neutron">Neutron</h2>
<p>A neutron is a subatomic particle with no charge. It is also found in the nucleus of an atom. The number of neutrons can vary in different atoms of the same element, and atoms with different numbers of neutrons are called isotopes.</p>
<h2 id="electron">Electron</h2>
<p>An electron is a subatomic particle with a negative charge. It orbits the nucleus of an atom. Electrons are involved in chemical reactions and bonding.</p>
<h2 id="mass-number">Mass Number</h2>
<p>The mass number of an atom is the sum of the number of protons and neutrons in the nucleus. It is represented by the letter A.</p>
<h2 id="atomic-number">Atomic Number</h2>
<p>The atomic number of an atom is the number of protons in the nucleus. It is represented by the letter Z. The atomic number determines the element of the atom.</p>
<h2 id="isotopes">Isotopes</h2>
<p>Isotopes are atoms of the same element with different numbers of neutrons. They have the same atomic number but different mass numbers. Isotopes can have different properties and uses. For example, radioactive isotopes are used in medicine and industry.</p>
<p>Overall, understanding the subatomic particles of atoms and how they interact is crucial in understanding the properties of matter and how it behaves in the world around us.</p>
